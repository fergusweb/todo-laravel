        This is an experiment with Laravel 11.  I'm building a simple TODO app.
    </p>
    <p>
        The app uses Breeze for authentication & user management. Users can add a task,
        and add items to that task.  You can tick off items, and once all items are done the
        task is complete.

    <p>We're making heavy use of Tailwind CSS too.</p>
